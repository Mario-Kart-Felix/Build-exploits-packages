Details
CVE-2013-7459
critical severity
Vulnerable versions: <= 2.6.1
Patched version: No fix
Heap-based buffer overflow in the ALGnew function in block_templace.c in Python Cryptography Toolkit (aka pycrypto) allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code as demonstrated by a crafted iv parameter to cryptmsg.py.

CVE-2018-6594
high severity
Vulnerable versions: <= 2.6.1
Patched version: No fix
lib/Crypto/PublicKey/ElGamal.py in PyCrypto through 2.6.1 generates weak ElGamal key parameters, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading ciphertext data (i.e., it does not have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack). The Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption does not hold for PyCrypto's ElGamal implementation.
