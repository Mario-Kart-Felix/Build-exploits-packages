Details
CVE-2018-18074
high severity
Vulnerable versions: <= 2.19.1
Patched version: 2.20.0
The Requests package through 2.19.1 before 2018-09-14 for Python sends an HTTP Authorization header to an http URI upon receiving a same-hostname https-to-http redirect, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover credentials by sniffing the network.
