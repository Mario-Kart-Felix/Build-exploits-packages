Details
CVE-2021-20270
high severity
Vulnerable versions: >= 1.5, < 2.7.4
Patched version: 2.7.4
An infinite loop in SMLLexer in Pygments versions 1.5 to 2.7.3 may lead to denial of service when performing syntax highlighting of a Standard ML (SML) source file, as demonstrated by input that only contains the "exception" keyword.

CVE-2021-27291
moderate severity
Vulnerable versions: >= 1.1, < 2.7.4
Patched version: 2.7.4
In pygments 1.1+, fixed in 2.7.4, the lexers used to parse programming languages rely heavily on regular expressions. Some of the regular expressions have exponential or cubic worst-case complexity and are vulnerable to ReDoS. By crafting malicious input, an attacker can cause a denial of service.
