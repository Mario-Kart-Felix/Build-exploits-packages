Remediation
Upgrade cryptography to version 3.2 or later. For example:

cryptography>=3.2
Always verify the validity and compatibility of suggestions with your codebase.

Details
GHSA-hggm-jpg3-v476
moderate severity
Vulnerable versions: < 3.2
Patched version: 3.2
Impact
RSA decryption was vulnerable to Bleichenbacher timing vulnerabilities, which would impact people using RSA decryption in online scenarios.

Patches
This is fixed in cryptography 3.2. pyca/cryptography@58494b4 is the resolving commit.

CVE-2018-10903
high severity
Vulnerable versions: >= 1.9.0, < 2.3
Patched version: 2.3
A flaw was found in python-cryptography versions between >=1.9.0 and <2.3. The finalize_with_tag API did not enforce a minimum tag length. If a user did not validate the input length prior to passing it to finalize_with_tag an attacker could craft an invalid payload with a shortened tag (e.g. 1 byte) such that they would have a 1 in 256 chance of passing the MAC check. GCM tag forgeries can cause key leakage.
