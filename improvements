Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty                                           40
--The member’s leadership and job performance in their primary duty, including the
development of new techniques, must have significantly contributed to increase
mission effectiveness during the year. Individual accomplishments are essential—not
unit accomplishments
Significant Self Improvement                                                             20
--The member must have shown improvement through off-duty education,
achievements in professional or cultural societies or associations, development of
creative abilities, and so on, during the award period. Consider military and civilian
classes, professional development, self-development, etc. In general, self-
improvement that is voluntary carries more weight than simply attending a
mandatory class
Base and Community Involvement                                                           20
--The member must have contributed to the military or civilian community’s welfare,
morale or status during the reporting period. This includes base/squadron/community
involvement such as the Top-3, booster club, CGO group, coach of a youth athletic
team, scout leader, church elder, etc. Being a member of an organization is not as
strong as participation in a leadership position (president, secretary, coach, etc)
